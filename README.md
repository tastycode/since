The American police killed more people in March of 2015 than have been
killed by police in the UK in 100 years. There is clearly another
solution to police executions.

For me, the way I can contribute is to raise awareness of the frequency
of police killings by promoting the question and answer.

> How long has it been since the cops executed someone without due process? 

Right now, this project only answers this question, but we could expand
this to raise awareness on social media about other social issues.

> How long has it been since the last chemical weapon attack?

> How long has it been since the last shot fired between Israel and Palestine?

> How long has it been since a child was killed in the US due to our gun
> policy?

The bottleneck here is in collecting the data. Right now, I'd actually
have to manually update the code everytime a police killing happens,
having some sort of automated social consensus would be AWESOME!
